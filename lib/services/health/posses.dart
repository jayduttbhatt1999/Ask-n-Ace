We all get possessive regarding our special bonds or friends or family members atleast at one point of time right? And that’s natural and obvious right? Well, this thinking of taking being possessive as taken for granted is the most unhealthy thing that we do to ruin our bonds. We often forget that there is a fine line between being protective and being possessive.

As a result, we actually cause harm to our mental health by ruining the bonds. So today I’ll share some ways and practical facts which may help you to understand the dark side of being possessive. Though I can’t say that you will get rid of it so easily but once you understand the problem then hopefully you will be able to act maturely. So let’s not waste any more time and get started to our today’s topic.""",

There’s nothing wrong in taking time to heal, but giving the same pain to your close ones in the process of healing is wrong. Remember one thing, your past and present can never be same, so stop comparing both. Start realising that you are not in your past anymore and your presence has no space for your past.

Not only that, it may lead to a lot more fights. So the other person gradually will start taking you for granted and will eventually go far away from you.

It may be probably possible that you judged them based on a rumour, then they will feel that when there’s no basic trust in a relationship then there’s no point of keeping it. keep this in mind to stop being possessive.

So these were 5 most practical ways which may help you understand your fault. And if you are possessive because your partner’s action makes you do so then you are mature enough to understand that you need to walk out of the toxicity in order to achieve something better in life right?
