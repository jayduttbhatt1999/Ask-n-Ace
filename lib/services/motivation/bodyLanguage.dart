The 3 V’s namely, verbal, vocal, and visual are also identified. An interaction can therefore be separated into two sections i.e. verbal and non-verbal. If someone says he’s truthful, for instance, then the verbal saying is “I am very honest,” and they are counted to be body language if they attempt to avoid eye contact, sweat, or look nervous. Thus, a big part of human conversation is body language. This encompasses all forms of communication, such as moving the hands, when attempting to describe something or the nervousness seen in the interview.
You may say that using the wrong body language makes your expression almost useless. To cover up any bad body language, you should have a lot of ability in many aspects. Even if you do not do poor work, body language can make a huge difference to your speech. It is, therefore, necessary for everyone to be careful about body language.""",
